- 'kmcload.py': This is a Python script that provides functionality for loading and decompressing images saved in the KMeans Clustering format. The script includes functions for reading a KMeans Compressed image file from disk, converting a KMeans Compressed image back to an RGB image, and displaying the color palette and the decompressed image.

- 'kmcsave.py': This is a Python script that provides functionality for saving and compressing images in the KMeans Clustering format. The script includes functions for converting an RGB image to a KMeans Compressed image, saving a KMeans Compressed image file to disk, and displaying the color palette and the compressed image.

- 'sample_photos': This is a subdirectory that contains several bitmap images and their corresponding KMeans Compressed versions. Some of the files include 'elizabeth.bmp', 'elizabeth.bmp.km4', 'lydia.bmp', and 'lydia.bmp.km4'.
