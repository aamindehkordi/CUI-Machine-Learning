# CUI-Machine-Learning

The 'CUI-Machine-Learning' repository contains several directories, each of which contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data files related to different machine learning topics. Below is a brief description of each directory:

## Classification Directory

The `Classification` directory contains several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different classification techniques using various datasets. The directory also contains the datasets used in the scripts and notebooks. More details can be found in the [Classification folder](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Classification).

## Clustering Directory

The `Clustering` directory contains several Python scripts related to the K-Means Clustering algorithm. More details can be found in the [Clustering folder](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Clustering).

## Regression Directory

The `Regression` directory contains several Python scripts related to regression analysis. The scripts implement various regression algorithms and use them to make predictions on housing data. More details can be found in the [Regression folder](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Regression).

## Visual Chess Detection Directory

The `Visual Chess Detection` directory contains several Python scripts and a Jupyter notebook, as well as a CSV file named 'All.csv'. The Python scripts include 'final.py' and 'macro.py', and the Jupyter notebook is named 'final.ipynb'. More details can be found in the [Visual Chess Detection folder](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Visual%20Chess%20Detection).
