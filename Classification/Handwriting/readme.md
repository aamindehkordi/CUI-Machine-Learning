# README for the 'Handwriting' Subdirectory

The 'Handwriting' subdirectory is part of the 'Classification' directory in the 'CUI-Machine-Learning' repository. It contains several files related to handwriting analysis and recognition, including a Jupyter notebook, Python scripts, CSV files, and image files.

## Files in the 'Handwriting' Subdirectory

- **Jupyter Notebook:**

  - 'Decision Trees.ipynb': A notebook that likely contains a decision tree model. This could be a learning resource for understanding how decision trees can be applied to handwriting recognition.

- **Python Scripts:**

  - 'GUItemp.py': A Python script that likely involves GUI creation. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to create GUIs in Python.
  - 'handwriting.py': A Python script that likely involves handwriting analysis or recognition. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to analyze and recognize handwriting in Python.
  - 'mnist_demo.py': A Python script that likely involves a demonstration using the MNIST dataset. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to work with the MNIST dataset in Python.
  - 'pillow_demo.py': A Python script that likely involves a demonstration using the Pillow library for image processing. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to use the Pillow library in Python.
  - 'skimage_demo.py': A Python script that likely involves a demonstration using the skimage library for image processing. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to use the skimage library in Python.
  - 'tkinter_demo.py': A Python script that likely involves a demonstration using the Tkinter library for GUI creation. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to use the Tkinter library in Python.

- **CSV Files:**

  - 'drink_data_from_marius.csv': A CSV file that likely contains data related to drinks. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to work with CSV data in Python.
  - 'mnist_train.csv': A CSV file that likely contains training data from the MNIST dataset. This could be a learning resource for understanding how to work with training data in Python.

- **Image Files:**
  - 'dept_photo.jpeg', 'elizabeth.bmp', 'gs_elizabeth.bmp', 'gs_lydia.bmp', 'lydia.bmp', 'mnist_digit.jpg': Image files that are likely used in the image processing scripts or demonstrations. These could be learning resources for understanding how to work with image data in Python.

## Purpose of the 'Handwriting' Subdirectory

The 'Handwriting' subdirectory likely contains projects or demonstrations related to handwriting analysis and recognition. This could involve using machine learning models to classify handwritten digits or characters, or it could involve using image processing techniques to analyze or manipulate images of handwriting. The subdirectory serves as a valuable learning resource for these topics.
